	* complex.h: Try avoiding compile failure on platforms where
	log2() is defined as a macro, e.g. cygwin.

2008-10-12  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* real.cpp: Providing real argument acosh() and asinh() function
	on platfoms where these do not exist (e.g. MSVC).

2008-01-17  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* fspecial.cpp (isinf): Fixed some compile issues for native sgi
	IRIX compiler.

2008-01-15  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* cbesselj.cpp: Added complex bessel function of first kind.
	Thanks a lot to Bastien!

2008-01-14  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* real.cpp: Added fallback function for real valued trunc().

	* complex.cpp: Renamed all complex functions probably having a
	complex<T> pendant, e.g., arcosh() to acosh().

2008-01-13  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* complex.h: Using std namespace; now using <complex/tr1> works
	somehow.

	* real.cpp: Reverted abs() -> fabs() renaming.

2008-01-12  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* real.cpp: Put real valued functions from complex file here.
	Also renamed abs() function (of complex, vector, matrix) to
	fabs() everywhere.

2008-01-10  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* Makefile.am: Creating math library.  Complex class has been
	renamed.  Now able to use also <complex> and <tr1/complex>.
	Thanks a lot to Bastien.  Renamed complex to nr_complex_t
	everywhere.

	* ChangeLog: Created this file.
