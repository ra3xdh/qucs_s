This file lists all the things we would like to add in the future.
Bugs are not listed here; for a list of all known bugs (fixed and
unfixed) have a look at the file BUGS.

(completed tasks are indented one tab)

- different color/thickness of wires in order to visualize
  different types of signals
- busses for digital designs (instead of wires only)
	- keeping input/output type of VHDL subcircuits based on VHDL files
- real library creation using VHDL (precompiled objects as well as
  libraries)
- eye-diagram implementation
- editing long property lines (multi-line inputs), e.g. for EDD device
- what about S-parameter file references in library elements?
- Verilog-HDL editor based on VHDL editor
- allow mirroring, placement of component arrays and alike while
  inserting/pasting a new components
	- handle subcircuits in library components as well as other file
	  references correctly
- simulation messages are sometimes swallowed by the output parser due
  to the concept how the progress bar is extracted, fix this
- check if -fno-rtti can be used
- in order to abort the qucsdigi script use tryTerminate, then kill
	- add an export to csv file feature as context menu item when
	  clicking on graphs in diagrams
	- add an easy to use volt-meter (for differential voltages)
	- implementation of 3d cartesian diagram
	- node/branch annotation of simulation results
	- filter design tool
	- implement coplanar line synthesis/analysis in transmission
	  line tool
	- smith chart design tool for impedance and noise matching
	- attenuator design tool
- topology check (open ports) for schematics
	- implement user-defined subcircuit paintings
	- make tabdiagram 'scrollable' (for long value lists)
- allow tabdiagram to display variables with different dependencies
	- shutdown external programs on application exit
	- implement list parameter sweeps
- allow components to be painted in a certain order (implement drawing
  depth)
- improve wiring algorithm
	- don't change into project directory or any other directory
	- microwave line calculation program
	- filter synthesis program
- import filters for different data formats (ADS, touchstone, etc.)
	- s-parameter simulator program
	- DC analysis
	- internet representation
- creation of documentation, introductions and help texts
- translation of internal help texts shipped with Qucs
- paint logos and other drawings
	- modify/create configure scripts
	- load/save/print schematics
	- partial polar/smith chart
- compatibility code and testing on other platforms as GNU/Linux
	- components: correlated noise sources, symbolically defined
	  devices
	- optimization dialog box
- snap mode for wire painting
	- edit component parameters directly in schematic
- equations for diagram input line
- 3D clipping
- legend for diagrams
- syntax highlighting for VHDL printing
- tune simulation parameters
- simulation of tolerances (Monte Carlo)
	- aligning functions: center horizontal/vertically
- property file for projects (revision, last opened, ...)
- all coordinates as float variables
- PCB layout documents
