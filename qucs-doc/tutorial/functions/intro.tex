This manual describes the measurement expressions available in
\char`\"{}Qucs\char`\"{}, the \char`\"{}Quite Universal Circuit
Simulator\char`\"{}.

Measurement expressions come into play whenever the results of a
\char`\"{}Qucs\char`\"{} simulation run need post processing. Examples
would be the conversion of a simulated voltage waveform from volts to
dBV, the root mean square value of that waveform or the determination
of the peak voltage. The
\char`\"{}Qucs\char`\"{} measurement functions offer a rich set of
data manipulation tools.

If you are not familiar with the way how to enter those formulas,
please refer to chapter \textit{``\nameref{chapter:use}''}, which
points out the possibilities to create and change measurement
expressions. Also the data types supported are specified here. Chapter
\textit{``\nameref{chapter:syntax}''} introduces the basic syntax of
functions and a categorical list of all functions available. The core
of the document, a detailed compilation of all ''Qucs'' functions
divided into different categories, is presented in chapter
\textit{``\nameref{chapter:math}''} and chapter
\textit{``\nameref{chapter:electronics}''}.  Finally, the
\textit{\hyperlink{chapter:appendix}{Index}} contains an alphabetical list
of all functions.
