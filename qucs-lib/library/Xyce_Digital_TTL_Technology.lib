*  Xyce TTL digital technology .MODEL. 
*
*  Basic TTL 5V positive supply.
*
*  A copy of this model must be placed on 
*  (a) a Xyce top level circuit schematic whith linear and standard TTL digital components only, 
*  or on 
*  (b) a Xyce user defined subckt which contains linear and standard TTL digital components only.
* 
*  See the the Qucs-S Help documentation formore information on how to construct and simulate Xyce schematics with
*  linear components and logic components built with different technologies.
*
*  Note the Xyce "DIG" technology model name is DMOD. This is the same for all types of Qucs-S Xyce digital technologies
*  and must NOT be changed.
